# Misconceptions About Recycling

## Myth #1
### Recycling is more expensive than disposal...

## Truth
### A well-run recycling program can be just as cost effective as regular trash disposal.

## Myth #2
### Making products from recycled materials is too expensive...

## Truth
### The cost of making products from recycled materials is generally comparable to that of making products from new materials. In the case of aluminum, using fresh aluminum costs 2X as much as recycled aluminum.

## Myth #3
## Recycling uses more energy than it saves...

## Truth
### Making products from recycled materials uses, on average, 50% less energy than making them from new materials! Recycling aluminum cans requires 95% less energy than producing them from raw materials, saving approximately 40 barrels of oil and 14,000 hours of kilowatt energy!

## Myth #4
### Biodegradable plastic doesn't need to be recycled...

## Truth
### Decomposition of improperly treated biodegradable plastic releases methane gas into the atmosphere. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2!

## Myth #5
### Recycling doesn't save natural resources...

## Truth
### Recycling drastically reduces the amount of natural resources that must be harvested or mined to collect and process raw materials.

## Myth #6
### We recycle as much as we can...

## Truth
### There are many products making their way to landfills that could easily be recycled. There is a lot of room for improvement! Americans, on average, recycle approximately 28% of their waste but some communities have proven that that number can be as high as 50% or more!

## Myth #7
### My trash will decompose anyway...

## Truth
### While it is true that most materials will break down over time, it can take a thousand years (or more!) for that to happen in a landfill.

## Myth #8
### Recycling trucks waste energy...

## Truth
### The amount of energy used by recycling trucks is more than made up for by the overall amount of energy that recycling saves. According to the EPA, recycling in 2006 caused a reduction of 49.7 million metric tons of carbon emissions which is comparable to removing 39.4 million passenger cars from the road.

## Myth #9
### People don't want to buy recycled products...

## Truth
### Markets exist for all of the commonly collected recycled materials and demand is high. People are motivated by both economics and their conscience to purchase goods made from recycled products! The value of recycled products is over $5 billion a year. Over 1,400 different products use post-consumer plastics. In 1999, recycled paper provided more than 37% of the raw material fiber needed by U.S. paper mills.

## Myth #10
### Burning waste in an incinerator is better than recycling...

## Truth
### Incinerators produce energy but also an awful lot of greenhouse gas at a high cost to both taxpayers and the envirionment!

# Environmental Responsibility

Today, we will be exploring perspectives on environmenetal responsibility. Your current group will analyze and discuss 1 of 5 topics related to environmental responsibility, and then we will form new groups where everyone has read about a different topic. This second group will share and reflect on all 5 topics and discuss situations regarding environmental responsibility here at Turing and outside of it. 

## Reading (~10 Minutes)

## Writing: Round 1 (~5 Minutes)
 Consider the following questions and write about them in your notebook:
* What do you think were the strongest arguments in these pieces?
* What considerations were overlooked?
* Were there any details that surprised you? If so, what?
* How do the authors' position affect your sense of individual responsibility around this topic? How does it affect the Turing community's responsibility?

## Discussion: Round 1 (~10 Minutes)

Based on what group you're in, discuss the following questions:

#### 1. Apathy
  * What do you think are the greatest barriers to taking action for a cause?
  * Do you think these are legitimate reasons? Why or why not?
  * When is a time when you felt frustrated by another person's apathy? What could you do to engage a person who is apathetic?


#### 2. Policy & Systematic Change
  * Is working for policy change a meaningful way to address environmental issues?
  * What are obstacles to creating policy change? What can we do about it?
  * If policy change is not a meaningful way to address these issues, what is? 


#### 3. Resources as Fuel for Industrialization & Growth
  * Is there an inherent trade-off between economic growth and environmental degradation?
  * Is the inequity that has resulted from market-driven development acceptable? Why or why not?
  * If those inequities are unacceptable, what could be done to address them?


#### 4. Morality & Religion
  * Is there a moral, religious, or spiritual reason to be environmentally responsible? 
  * Do you think there is a place for moral, religious, or spiritual thought to guide environmental policy?
  * How can we engage in a productive conversation with people who have different perspectives from us?


#### 5. Radical Environmentalism
  * What are your initial reactions to this piece?
  * What premise(s) particularly strike you? Why? Do you agree with it? Why or why not?
  * Is industrial civilization inherently unsustainable? Is there value in working towards a sustainable society?

## Discussion: Round 2 (~20 Minutes)

Get into your new groups where there is a representative from each topic group. After each sharing a summary of your topic and the discussion that happened in your first group, consider the following questions:

  * What approach would you like to see Turing take toward this issue of environmental responsibility? Has that changed after being exposed to new perspectives? Why?
  * If Turing could impart one skill on graduates that would help them bring a more environmentally responsible culture to their future employers, what should that skill be?
  * What role do businesses and tech companies play in environmental responsibility? 

## Debrief: (~5 Minutes)
Gather together in the big workspace, where each group will share their main takeaways.

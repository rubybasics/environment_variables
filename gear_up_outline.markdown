# Environmental Responsibility at Turing

The goals of Gear Up are to encourage conversation around topics that affect our community, and help us arrive at thoughtful, shared goals that unite us.

Turing would be doing its students a disservice if it sought to merely indoctrinate students toward a particular position. Instead, it makes sense for us to focus on gaining new skills that can help all students be critical thinkers, self-aware, and capable of working together to advance shared goals. 

Today's exercise will take on an important and yet controversial topic: environmental responsibility. You will be asked to familiarize yourself with one of several popular positions regarding organizational and individual environmental responsibility, and then you will have a chance to discuss these positions with students who've studied other perspectives. In the end, we will discuss what types of actions around environmental responsibility make sense for us at Turing to pursue as a community.

## Discussion: Round 1 (~10 Minutes)

Let's spend about 10 minutes familiarizing ourselves with the details of the positions we read and watched.

* What do you think were the strongest arguments in these essays?
* What considerations have been overlooked?
* Were there any details that surprised you?
* How does the author's position affect your sense of individual responsibility around this topic? How does it affect the Turing community's responsibility?

## Discussion: Round 2 (~15 Minutes)
Break into new groups with a representative from each topic group. Together, tackle these questions:

* Imagine you had a budget of $100 per week to dedicate toward making Turing environmentally responsible? How would you spend it?
* You're planning the next Field Day: Would you choose to organize the day around service? or around something more relaxed and just social? Why?
* If Turing could impart one skill on graduates that would help them bring a more environmentally responsible culture to their future employers, what should that skill be? 
* Regarding the three questions above, where did you have the most disagreement? Why do you think that was?
* Did you reach consensus on any of these topics? Where? Why?
